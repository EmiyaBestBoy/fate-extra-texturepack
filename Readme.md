# Description
This project intends to deliver a full texture pack for *Fate/Extra* on PSP. It is not intended to look professional, but will attempt look fairly polished.

# Installation
The texture pack is meant to be used with the *PPSSPP* emulator. This is the procedure to apply this texture pack.
1. Get the Emulator. It is available [here](http://www.ppsspp.org/).
  * Regardless of using the zip/installer version, make sure you know where it is installed. The location will be important later.
2. Get a copy of the US release of the game.
  * No link can be provided here, as you should dump it yourself using a copy you physically own.
3. Go to *PPSSPP*'s installation folder.
  * If there is no MemStick folder, run the emulator once.
4. Go to the MemStick/PSP folder, and create a TEXTURES folder.
  * In this newly created folder, create one called ULUS10576 (which is the game's ID).
5. Download this repository using the Clone or Download option, and download as a Zip file.
6. Extract the contents of the zip file to the ULUS10576 folder so that textures.ini is in the root of the folder.
7. Boot the game in the emulator, and activate texture replacement.
  * This option should be enabled by default, but if it is not the case, it is under Tools>Developer tools>Replace textures
