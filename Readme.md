Here is my attempt at continuing this HD texture pack. I probably forgot to commit some files here because I actually stopped development when I finished playing Fate Extra. Make sure to download from releases just in case I forgot some files here.

# Original Description down below
# Description
This project intends to deliver a full texture pack for *Fate/Extra* on PSP. It is not intended to look professional, but will attempt look fairly polished. This texture pack is meant to be approximately 1080p quality textures (the PSP resolution makes having exactly 1080P a chore) which means everything is 4 times their original size.

# Installation
The texture pack is meant to be used with the *PPSSPP* emulator. This is the procedure to apply this texture pack:
* Get the Emulator. It is available [here](http://www.ppsspp.org/).
  * Regardless of using the zip/installer version, make sure you know where it is installed. The location will be important later.
* Get a copy of the US release of the game.
  * No link can be provided here, as you should dump it yourself using a copy you physically own.
* Go to *PPSSPP*'s installation folder.
  * If there is no MemStick folder, run the emulator once.
* Go to the MemStick/PSP folder, and create a TEXTURES folder.
  * In this newly created folder, create one called ULUS10576 (which is the game's ID).
* Download this repository using the Clone or Download option, and download as a Zip file.
* Extract the contents of the zip file to the ULUS10576 folder so that textures.ini is in the root of the folder.
* Boot the game in the emulator, and activate texture replacement.
  * This option should be enabled by default, but if it is not the case, it is under Tools>Developer tools>Replace textures

# Contributing
I'm by no means an artist, so I use upscaling algorithms to get decent looking upscales of stuff I cannot do manually (mostly characters/decor textures). I do touch up the results so it really doesn't look too bad, but I'm willing to accept proper remakes of the files. If you need help getting the original textures, send me a message.

# Credits
All these textures are modifications of the orignals, except most of the HUD elements, which I remade myself and some other miscellaneous textures. I do not own any of the original textures, credit goes to the trademark/copyright holders. As for my work, I would like credit (simply mentioning my username is enough) if you do use them.
